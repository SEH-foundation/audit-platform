# Archive Notes

This folder is a holding area for legacy components that should **not** be used
in production workflows. It documents what was intentionally **not migrated**
from older repos.

## Not Migrated (by design)
- Legacy memory system (separate services) -> kept out of core workflow
- GitHub/GDrive integrations -> postponed until requirements are finalized
- Experimental scoring variants -> removed in favor of fixed standard formulas

## Source Repos (Legacy)
- `/Users/maksymdemchenko/repo-auditor`
- `/Users/maksymdemchenko/audit-app`

If you want me to move any code into this archive or remove old repos, tell me
which paths are safe to modify.
